### 11.1 Age Restrictions

**Minimum Age: 18 years old**

PortraitWiz is not intended for and may not be used by individuals under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under 18.

**Why 18 when GDPR allows 13-16?**
- Biometric data processing requires mature consent
- Subscription contracts require legal capacity (18 in Latvia)

If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child under 18 has provided us with personal data:
- Contact us immediately at [privacy email]
- Provide child's account information
- We will delete the account and all associated data promptly
- We may request verification of your parental relationship

### 11.3 Additional Protection for Minors

**Latvia implements age 13 for information society services** under GDPR Article 8. While our minimum age is 18, if we discover users between 13-18:
- We require parental consent for continued use
- May restrict certain features
- Apply enhanced data protection measures
- May terminate accounts if parental consent cannot be obtained

### 11.4 Verification

We do not systematically verify ages but rely on:
- Age confirmation during account creation

- Monitoring for indicators of underage use
- Reports from parents or guardians

If we have reason to believe a user is under 18, we will:
- Request age verification
