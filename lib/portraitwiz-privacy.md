**Minimum Age: 18 years old**

PortraitWiz is not intended for and may not be used by individuals under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under 18.

**Why 18 when GDPR allows 13-16?**

### 11.4 Verification

We do not systematically verify ages but rely on:
- Age confirmation during account creation

- Reports from parents or guardians

If we have reason to believe a user is under 18, we will:
