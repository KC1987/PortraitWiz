- Section 15 (Dispute Resolution)
- Section 16 (Governing Law)
- Any provision which by its nature should survive

## 15. Dispute Resolution

### 15.1 Informal Resolution

Before initiating formal proceedings, we encourage you to contact us at [support email] to resolve disputes informally. Many issues can be resolved through direct communication.

### 15.2 Voluntary Mediation

The parties may agree to attempt voluntary mediation before pursuing court action. Mediation is entirely voluntary and does not affect either party's right to pursue judicial remedies. Participation in mediation does not constitute a prerequisite to court proceedings.

**Mediation Process:**
- Either party may propose mediation
- Both parties must agree to participate
- Parties share mediation costs equally (unless otherwise agreed)
- Time spent in mediation suspends limitation periods
- Mediation agreements may be made enforceable through court approval

### 15.3 No Mandatory Arbitration

**YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO USE ARBITRATION.** You retain the full right to bring any dispute to court. Any arbitration must be agreed to individually after a dispute arises and may not be imposed through these Terms.

Pre-dispute arbitration clauses are unenforceable for EU consumers under Directive 93/13/EEC.

### 15.4 Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)

If you are a consumer, you may also access alternative dispute resolution through:

**Latvia Consumer Rights Protection Centre (PTAC):**
- Website: https://www.ptac.gov.lv/en
- Role: Consumer protection enforcement, complaint handling
- Process: Free consumer complaint submission and resolution assistance

**European Consumer Centres Network:**
- Available for cross-border consumer disputes
- Provides advice and assistance for EU consumers

**Note:** The EU Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform was discontinued on July 20, 2025. Please contact PTAC directly or use other available ADR mechanisms.

### 15.5 Consumer Court Access

**IF YOU ARE A CONSUMER:**

You may bring legal proceedings related to these Terms in either:
- The courts of the Republic of Latvia, OR
- The courts of your country of residence (EU Member State)

You may choose the jurisdiction most convenient for you.

If we wish to bring legal proceedings against you as a consumer, we may only do so in the courts of your country of residence.

### 15.6 Business Disputes

If you are using the Service for business purposes (not as a consumer), any disputes arising from these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Riga, Latvia.

### 15.7 Class Action Waiver Not Applicable

Under EU law, consumers cannot be prevented from participating in class actions or representative proceedings. Any provision purporting to prevent class action participation is void and unenforceable for EU consumers.

## 16. Governing Law

### 16.1 Choice of Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the Republic of Latvia, without regard to conflict of law principles.

### 16.2 Consumer Protection Preservation

**IF YOU ARE A CONSUMER RESIDING IN ANOTHER EU MEMBER STATE:**

You also benefit from the mandatory consumer protection provisions of the law of your country of residence that provide a higher level of protection than Latvian law. Nothing in these Terms limits your rights under those national consumer protection laws.

The choice of Latvian law does not deprive you of the protection afforded by mandatory provisions of law that would apply if:
- You resided in Latvia, OR
- The contract has close connection to your country of residence

This is required under Article 6(2) of the Rome I Regulation and ensures you retain all consumer rights under your national law where those rights exceed Latvian protections.

### 16.3 Regulatory Compliance

We comply with:
- EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2016/679
- EU Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation 2024/1689)
- EU Digital Services Act (Regulation 2022/2065)
- EU Consumer Rights Directive 2011/83/EU as amended
- EU Unfair Contract Terms Directive 93/13/EEC
- Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) 2015/2366
- Latvian Consumer Rights Protection Law
- Latvian Data Protection Law implementing GDPR

## 17. General Provisions

### 17.1 Entire Agreement

These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and any other documents expressly incorporated by reference, constitute the entire agreement between you and Supershoot regarding the Service and supersede all prior agreements and understandings.

### 17.2 Amendments to Terms

We may modify these Terms from time to time to reflect:
- Changes in law or regulatory requirements

- Security or safety improvements
- Clarifications or corrections

**Notice of Material Changes:**

**Immaterial Changes:**
- Minor changes (typos, clarifications, non-substantive updates) effective immediately
- Updated "Last Modified" date indicates changes

### 17.3 Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms otherwise remain in full force and effect.

This is particularly important for EU consumer protection: if any limitation of liability or other provision is deemed unfair or unenforceable for consumers, that provision shall not apply to consumer contracts, while remaining valid for business users.

### 17.4 Waiver

Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of that provision or any other provision. No waiver shall be effective unless in writing and signed by our authorized representative.

### 17.5 Assignment

You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights hereunder without our prior written consent. Any attempted assignment without consent is void.

We may assign these Terms and all rights granted hereunder, including with respect to your content and generated portraits, without restriction and without notice. This includes assignment to affiliates, subsidiaries, or in connection with merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of assets.

### 17.6 No Third-Party Beneficiaries

These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than you and Supershoot.

Exception: Data subjects have third-party beneficiary rights under Standard Contractual Clauses incorporated in Data Processing Agreements with our processors.

### 17.7 Force Majeure Definition

For purposes of these Terms, "force majeure" means abnormal and unforeseeable circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the party claiming force majeure, the consequences of which could not have been avoided despite exercise of all due care.

Force majeure does NOT include:
- Economic hardship or increased costs alone
- Foreseeable events existing at time of contract
- Events caused by claiming party's own actions or omissions
- Lack of funds or financial difficulties
- Failure of subcontractors or suppliers (except where caused by qualifying force majeure affecting supplier)

### 17.8 Language

These Terms are provided in English. If translated, the English version prevails in case of any inconsistency or different interpretation.

### 17.9 Notices
