Creating stunning AI portraits starts with a great prompt. Whether you're new to AI image generation or looking to improve your results, understanding how to craft effective prompts is essential for getting the portraits you envision.

## Understanding Prompt Structure

A well-structured prompt typically consists of several key elements:

### 1. Subject Description

Start by clearly describing your subject. Be specific about:

- Age range and gender
- Facial features and expressions
- Hairstyle and color
- Clothing and accessories

**Example:** "A professional woman in her 30s with shoulder-length brown hair, wearing a business suit"

### 2. Style and Mood

Define the artistic style and emotional tone:

- Photography style (portrait, headshot, candid)
- Lighting conditions (natural light, studio lighting, golden hour)
- Mood (confident, friendly, serious, relaxed)

**Example:** "Studio portrait photography with soft lighting, confident and professional mood"

### 3. Background and Setting

Describe the environment:

- Indoor or outdoor setting
- Specific location details
- Background blur or focus

**Example:** "Clean white studio background with subtle shadows"

## Best Practices for AI Portrait Prompts

### Be Specific but Concise

While detail is important, avoid overwhelming the AI with too much information. Focus on the most important elements.

**Good:** "Professional headshot of a smiling man in his 40s, wearing glasses and a navy suit, soft studio lighting"

**Too Vague:** "A person"

**Too Complex:** "A 42-year-old man with exactly 3 wrinkles on his forehead, wearing a navy suit with 4 buttons, in a room with 2 windows..."

### Use Photography Terms

AI models trained on photography understand technical terms:

- Depth of field (shallow, deep)
- Focal length (85mm, 50mm)
- Lighting types (Rembrandt, butterfly, split)
- Camera angles (eye-level, slightly above, three-quarter view)

### Emphasize Important Elements

If certain aspects are crucial, mention them early in your prompt or use emphasis indicators:

- "Close-up portrait focusing on expressive eyes"
- "Professional headshot with emphasis on warm, friendly smile"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Conflicting Descriptions

Avoid contradictory elements in your prompt:

**Problematic:** "Formal business portrait in casual beachwear"

### 2. Overly Artistic Language

While creativity is good, overly poetic descriptions can confuse AI:

**Better:** "Warm, golden hour lighting"
**Worse:** "Bathed in the ethereal glow of twilight's tender embrace"

### 3. Negative Descriptions

Focus on what you want, not what you don't want. Instead of "no blurry background," try "sharp focus on subject with clean background"

## Reference Images: Your Secret Weapon

PortraitWiz allows you to upload up to 4 reference images. This is incredibly powerful:

- Upload multiple photos of yourself from different angles
- The AI analyzes all images together for better facial accuracy
- Provides consistent results across different prompts
- Reduces the need for detailed facial descriptions

**Pro tip:** Use clear, well-lit photos from various angles for best results.

## Example Prompt Formulas

### Professional Headshot
```
Professional headshot of [description], wearing [clothing],
[lighting type], [background], confident expression,
high-quality portrait photography
```

### Creative Portrait
```
Artistic portrait of [description], [artistic style],
[lighting mood], [setting], [emotional tone],
professional photography
```

### Casual Portrait
```
Natural portrait of [description], [casual setting],
soft natural lighting, relaxed and friendly expression,
lifestyle photography
```

## Practice Makes Perfect

The best way to improve your prompt writing is through experimentation:

1. Start with a basic prompt
2. Generate an image and analyze the results
3. Adjust specific elements based on what you want to change
4. Keep notes on what works best for your style
