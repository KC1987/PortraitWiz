Creating AI portraits can be incredibly rewarding, but there are common mistakes that can lead to disappointing results. Whether you're new to AI-generated images or looking to improve your technique, understanding these pitfalls will help you create better portraits consistently.

## Mistake #1: Vague or Generic Prompts

### The Problem

Many users start with overly simple prompts like:
- "A portrait"
- "Person smiling"
- "Professional photo"

While AI can work with these, the results are often generic and lack personality.

### Why It Happens

When you're new to AI generation, it's natural to keep prompts simple. However, AI needs more context to create a portrait that matches your vision.

### The Solution

Be specific about key elements:

**Instead of:** "A professional portrait"

**Try:** "Professional headshot of a confident business executive in their 40s, wearing a navy suit, with soft studio lighting and a clean white background"

**Key elements to include:**
- Age range and gender
- Specific clothing or style
- Lighting type
- Background description
- Expression or mood
- Photography style

### Quick Fix

Add 3-5 specific descriptors to every prompt. Think about: who, what, where, how, and why.

## Mistake #2: Not Using Reference Images

### The Problem

Relying solely on text descriptions to capture specific facial features often leads to inconsistent or inaccurate results.

### Why It Happens

Many users don't realize that reference images dramatically improve results, or they only upload one photo.

### The Solution

PortraitWiz allows up to 4 reference images—use them!

**Best practices:**
1. Upload 3-4 clear photos of yourself
2. Use different angles (front, side, three-quarter)
3. Ensure good lighting in reference photos
4. Choose high-resolution images
5. Include natural expressions

**The difference:**
- **Text only:** AI guesses facial features from description
- **With references:** AI analyzes your actual face for accuracy

### Quick Fix

Before your next portrait generation, upload at least 2-3 reference photos from different angles. This single change can dramatically improve accuracy.

## Mistake #3: Conflicting Style Elements

### The Problem

Combining incompatible styles or moods in a single prompt creates confused, inconsistent results.

**Examples of conflicts:**
- "Formal business portrait in casual beachwear"
- "High-key bright lighting with dramatic dark shadows"
- "Minimalist clean background with complex busy environment"
- "Serious professional expression while laughing"

### Why It Happens

When brainstorming ideas, it's easy to combine elements you like without considering if they work together.

### The Solution

Choose a clear, consistent vision:

**Pick one primary style:**
- Professional/corporate
- Casual/lifestyle
- Artistic/creative
- Glamour/fashion
- Natural/candid

**Match all elements to that style:**

**Professional:**
- Clothing: Business suit or formal attire
- Lighting: Soft studio lighting or even illumination
- Background: Clean, simple, or office setting
- Expression: Confident, friendly, or serious

**Artistic:**
- Clothing: Interesting textures or unique fashion
- Lighting: Dramatic or creative (Rembrandt, split lighting)
- Background: Complementary to mood (textured, colored, minimal)
- Expression: Thoughtful, intense, or emotive

### Quick Fix

Write your prompt, then review it for conflicts. Ask yourself: "Do all these elements support the same overall mood and style?"

## Mistake #4: Ignoring Lighting Descriptions

### The Problem

Generic lighting terms or no lighting descriptions at all lead to flat, unprofessional-looking portraits.

**Weak lighting descriptions:**
- "Good lighting"
- "Nice light"
- "Well-lit"

### Why It Happens

Lighting is a complex topic in photography, and many users don't know the technical terms.

### The Solution

Learn and use specific lighting terminology:

**For professional portraits:**
- "Soft studio lighting with subtle shadows"
- "Loop lighting setup with neutral color temperature"
- "Even illumination with softbox lighting"

**For natural portraits:**
- "Golden hour sunlight with warm tones"
- "Soft window light from the left side"
- "Overcast natural light with even illumination"

**For dramatic portraits:**
- "Rembrandt lighting with strong shadows"
- "Split lighting creating high contrast"
- "Low-key lighting with dark background"

### Quick Fix

Choose one specific lighting style and add it to your prompt. Reference our [lighting guide](/blog/lighting-tips-ai-portraits) for more options.

## Mistake #5: Not Iterating and Refining

### The Problem

Expecting perfect results on the first try and giving up when they don't meet expectations.

### Why It Happens

AI generation seems magical, so people expect instant perfection. In reality, even professional photographers take multiple shots.

### The Solution

Treat AI generation as an iterative process:

**Step 1: Start with a baseline prompt**
Create a basic version with core elements

**Step 2: Analyze the result**
What worked? What didn't match your vision?

**Step 3: Make targeted adjustments**
Change ONE element at a time:
- Adjust lighting description
- Modify clothing details
- Refine background
- Alter expression or pose

**Step 4: Test variations**
Try 2-3 variations of your refined prompt

**Step 5: Find your formula**
Once you get great results, save that prompt structure for future use

### Quick Fix

Don't give up after one attempt. Generate at least 3 variations, making small changes to your prompt each time.

## Bonus Tip: Keep a Prompt Journal

### What It Is

A simple document where you record:
- Prompts you've used
- Results (screenshot or notes)
- What worked and what didn't
- Successful formulas

### Why It's Valuable

- Learn from your experiments
- Build a library of effective prompts
- Quickly recreate successful styles
- Develop your unique prompt-writing style

### How to Start

Create a simple note file with this format:

```
Date: [Date]
Prompt: [Full prompt]
Result: [Excellent/Good/Poor]
Notes: [What worked, what didn't]
Keep/Modify: [Keep for future or needs changes]
```

## Quick Checklist: Before Generating Your Portrait

Use this checklist before hitting generate:

- [ ] Is my prompt specific and detailed?
- [ ] Have I uploaded 2-4 reference images?
- [ ] Are all style elements consistent?
- [ ] Did I include specific lighting descriptions?
- [ ] Am I prepared to iterate if needed?
- [ ] Have I avoided conflicting descriptions?

## Common Questions

**Q: How long should my prompt be?**
A: Aim for 15-30 words covering the key elements. Quality over quantity.

**Q: Can I fix a portrait that didn't turn out well?**
A: Yes! Analyze what went wrong, adjust your prompt, and try again. AI generation is fast, so iteration is encouraged.

**Q: Should I use the same prompt for different people?**
A: You can use the same structure, but adjust descriptions to match each person's features and style preferences.

**Q: What if I get good results but want to try variations?**
A: Great! Keep your base prompt and make small, specific changes to explore variations.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Be specific** - Detail beats vagueness every time
2. **Use reference images** - They dramatically improve accuracy
3. **Stay consistent** - Match all elements to one cohesive style
4. **Master lighting terms** - Lighting defines professional quality
5. **Iterate and learn** - First try rarely perfect, refinement is key

## Ready to Put This Into Practice?

Now that you know what to avoid, you're ready to create stunning AI portraits. Remember:

- Start with a clear vision
- Be specific in your descriptions
- Use reference images
- Don't be afraid to refine and iterate
